    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm glad that you're here. This is a collection of my projects done as part of my coursework in UI-UX at Brown University. I hope you enjoy reading as much I enjoyed putting this together :)</p><center><img width = 40% src = cool.jpeg></img></center>

    <h3 class="p-border-bottom p-border-light-grey p-padding-16">PROJECTS</h3>
    <p>Following are some of the projects that I have created. The first three are UI-UX related projects which helped me learn core design concepts, principles of user experience formation, prototyping
      tools and user reaction evaluation. Throughout all my projects, I strived to maintain key usability principles such as smooth navigation, intuitive layout, and an engaging visual design.

  <div class="p-container" id="about">
    <h3 class="p-border-bottom p-border-light-grey p-padding-16">WHO AM I?</h3>
    <p>I am a senior year undergraduate student at Brown University concentrating in Computer Science and Economics. I am from India and have a passion for product
    management and human-centered design thinking. My interests lie in hiking, listening to world music, and exploring new cuisines.</p><p> During my time at Brown, I have taken courses in Virtual Reality,
    Cybersecuity, Game Theoretical Economics, International Relations, Contemporary Architecture, and South Asian studies. Having done an independent study in Data Driven Product Management, I have become
    very interested in learning about product cycles and the data culture in different organisations and different companies, and the various strategies and tools that can be used to optimize these
    processes. </p><p>I believe that it is just as important for a product manager to be well-versed with design principles and frameworks to work with UI-UX teams as they should be with computer science concepts
    to work with engineering teams. My coursework in UI-UX has augmented this learning by helping me gain an insight into persona building, storyboarding, experimentation, a/b testing,
    user surveying and iterative designing.</p><center><figure><img src = samhitha.jpg><figcaption><font color = grey>Artwork by Samhitha Chitturi</font></figcaption></figure></center>
