    <h2 class="w3-wide">ITERATIVE DESIGN: <b>SOCKSOHO</b></h2>
    <a href = https://socksoho.com/> <button class="w3-button w3-black w3-margin-bottom">Original SockSoho Website<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></button></a>
    <p class="w3-justify">SockSoho is a startup which aims to sell a variety of men's socks in India in unique and trendy designs and quality of cloth akin to Uniqlo.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> We picked this startup because we liked the idea of making fashion more accessible in India and we truly loved the designs on the socks and wanted them to reach more people.
      Our primary goals for our iterative design were: <ul> <li><p class="w3-justify"> simplification of functionality </p></li>
        <li> <p class="w3-justify">using minimalistic designs and color schemes </p></li>
        <li> <p class="w3-justify">finding the right balance between differentiating the website from
        other shopping websites and ensuring that the features are recallable by avid online shoppers.</p></li></ul>
      <p class = "w3-justify">We tried to meet these goals, along with meeting Jeff's goals for high quality user experience: usability, learnability, memorability and efficiency, as we iteratively designed the interface of this webpage.</p>

  <!-- sketches summary -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="usab">
    <h2 class="w3-wide">SKETCHES</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify"> We are designing a website interface. Our users will be male-identifying people shopping for socks for themselves or anyone shopping for men's socks for gifting purposes. Keeping these large variety of users and the geographic location of the startup in mind,
      we came up with the following sketches.</p>
    <img src = sketch_1.png width = "95%">
    <img src = sketch_2.png width = "95%">
    <img src = sketch_3.png width = "95%">
    <img src = sketch_4.png width = "95%">
  </div>

  <!-- wireframe summary -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="acce">
    <h2 class="w3-wide">WIREFRAMES</h2>
    <p class = "w3-justify"> We think that these sketches are effective in meeting the startup goals: introducing unique patterns to people who otherwise shop socks from known brands. They are different from the original website's color scheme, and clustered layout.
      In our next iteration of the design, we made these wireframes that follow the sketches closely but are different in the layout of the cart page.</p>
    <img src = wireframe_1.png width = "95%">
    <img src = wireframe_2.png width = "95%">
    <img src = wireframe_3.png width = "95%">
    <img src = wireframe_4.png width = "95%">

    <h2 class="w3-wide">PROTOTYPES</h2>
    <p class = "w3-justify"> Here is our high-fidelity mockup with all the interactive features we want to give to the real website. Before we finalized on this version of the mockup,
      we had a mockup with a slightly different shopping and cart pages. Our critique involved the following pieces of feedback: <ul>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">Replace the question mark icon with the words "Help Center" so it can more accurately convey the gist of the content on the "Help Page."</p></li>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">Modify the checkout page to include the price of each item. </p></li>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">Replace the black cart icon for "add to cart" action with the words "Add to cart" and sizes "S", "M", "L."</p></li>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">Add scrollable list in the cart page.</p></li>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">Include stars as rating scale in "Reviews" page. </p></li>
        <li><p class = "w3-justify">The cart page was unlike anything the critiques had seen before but they appreciated the uniqueness of it and believed that it would still be usable.</p></li>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">USER TESTING: RESULTS, ANALYSIS, RECORDINGS</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify"><ul>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Tasks we gave to users: <ul><li><p class="w3-justify">Imagine you have a question about the shipping logistics. How would you find help on the website?</li>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Browse the shopping page, add 3 items to the shopping cart and checkout.</li></ul>
      <p class="w3-justify">We also asked them general questions about their thoughts on the different pages, their impression of the start up, and how we could improve the mockups.</p>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Results</li></p>
      <div class = "w3-center"><video width="400" height= "300" controls><source src="user_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
      <div class = "w3-center"><video width="400" height= "300" controls><source src="user_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
      <div class = "w3-center"><video width="400" height= "300" controls><source src="user_3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Highlights</li></p>
      <ul><li><p class="w3-justify">We had a 100% success rate for task completion.</li></p>
        <li><p class="w3-justify">All users felt that their first impression of the website was that it was an online store that sells high quality product with unique designs. One user felt that the written content was too light, and they did not love the black frame.</li></p>
        <li><p class="w3-justify">The tasks were uninamously declared by the users as very easy to fulfill by navigating through the pages on the prototype.</li></p>
        <li><p class="w3-justify">For the reviews page, we received feedback to add bigger pictures, more testimonies and identities of reviewers to improve legitimacy of reviews and build a sense of trust.</li></p>
        <li><p class="w3-justify"></li></p></ul>
      <li><p class="w3-justify">Analysis</li></p></ul>
